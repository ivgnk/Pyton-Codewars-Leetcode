Remarks

1) The task is incorrectly formulated
1221. Split a String in Balanced Strings -- In this formulation, you can get a larger number of substrings. 
In order for the examples to be executed correctly, you need to add: "in the left and right parts of the line (the same number of kids)"

2) Signs of older Python versions in Leetcode
1185. Day of the Week - do not work match-case - Python 3.10 (2021)

3) Only Bash
193. Valid Phone Numbers
195. Tenth Line

4) Wrong Answer in Leetcode
1437. Check If All 1's Are at Least Length K Places Away -- 66 / 68 testcases passed //  Bad test: nums = [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1], k = 5

2809. Minimum Time to Make Array Sum At Most x -- in 513 / 1274 testcase

5) Time Limit Exceeded (Super long data)
0121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock -- 200 / 212 testcases passed
0278. First Bad Version -- 11 / 24 testcases passed --- It is necessary, apparently, to search by the method of dichotomy
0643. Maximum Average Subarray I --  124 / 127 testcases passed - if only Python facilities
1128. Number of Equivalent Domino Pairs -- 18 / 19 testcases passed
1160. Find Words That Can Be Formed by Characters -- 10 / 36 testcases passed
1299. Replace Elements with Greatest Element on Right Side -- 87 / 90 testcases passed
1200. Minimum Absolute Difference --  33 / 38 testcases passed
1984. Minimum Difference Between Highest and Lowest of K Scores -- 15 / 118 testcases passed

6) Memory Limit Exceeded
1640. Check Array Formation Through Concatenation -- 21 / 85 testcases passed
